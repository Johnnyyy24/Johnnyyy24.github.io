    <h1>Why I Left Medium to Build My Own Website</h1>
    <h4>After six years of writing on platforms like Medium, I&#39;m finally ditching them to build my own corner of the internet. Here&#39;s why.</h4>
    <p class="author-date"><time datetime="2025-08-10T17:29:14+08:00">August 10, 2025</time></p>

<p>For the past six years, I&rsquo;ve been writing on Medium, on and off. I&rsquo;ve flirted with other platforms too (Substack, X, you name it). But none of them ever felt right. It never felt like I was in control. At the end of the day, you realize these platforms are just trying to monetize <em>you</em>, even when you&rsquo;re the one supplying the content for their marketplace. And honestly, that&rsquo;s some serious bullshit.</p>
<p>I landed on three reasons why I&rsquo;m finally ditching those giants to build my own corner of the internet.</p>
<h2 id="mediums-seo-and-engagement-is-awful">Medium&rsquo;s SEO and Engagement is Awful<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mediums-seo-and-engagement-is-awful">#</a></h2>
<p>From my own little foxhole, my Medium stats have been in a nosedive compared to a few years ago. All the great writers I used to follow have packed up and left, which completely changed how I even use the platform anymore. I know, I know. That could just be my personal bias. So, I did some digging (and by that, I mean I grilled Gemini).</p>
<p>The data backs it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a ton of chatter about Medium&rsquo;s black-box algorithm, which seems to decide on a whim whether Google should even see your article.</li>
<li>The platform&rsquo;s bounce rate is around 70%. Is that just our collective short attention span, or is it Gresham&rsquo;s Law in action, where the bad content drives out the good?</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, the shitty SEO and engagement are what sent me looking for an exit in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="owning-my-own-shit">Owning My Own Shit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#owning-my-own-shit">#</a></h2>
<p>This weekend, I went down the rabbit hole of alternatives. I seriously considered Substack and Ghost. But it all came back to the same problem: you&rsquo;re just another user they&rsquo;re trying to monetize, on both the supply and the demand side. I can&rsquo;t imagine building something I want to run for the next 10 or 20 years with that kind of dependency hanging over my head.</p>
<p>Substack is too restrictive; the layouts are cookie-cutter and you can&rsquo;t really make it your own. And while Ghost is more flexible, it locks you into a monthly subscription just to keep the lights on. It all just felt&hellip; <em>off</em>. It was time to own my own shit.</p>
<h2 id="cuz-its-cool">Cuz It&rsquo;s Cool<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cuz-its-cool">#</a></h2>
<p>Honestly I got inspired by some friends who run their own killer personal websites. They write about personal growth and all sorts of deep topics. It&rsquo;s the kind of content that doesn&rsquo;t get pushed by social media algorithms and shit. When you find it, you just know it&rsquo;s authentic and genuinely thought-provoking. I want to be one of them: one of the cool kids who&rsquo;s comfortable sharing the real, internal stuff.</p>
<p>Plus, I have to admit, the process of actually building this site has been fun as hell. It&rsquo;s been so rewarding to (re)learn skills I&rsquo;d either forgotten or never mastered. Figuring out DNS, wrestling with layouts, finding a host&hellip; it was all part of this super cool, <em>aura-farming</em> experience (or at least, that&rsquo;s how I see it, haha).</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-next">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to try and make writing here a real habit. There&rsquo;s still a lot to figure out, like whether I should write in English or Mandarin, but this will be the place where I let my ideas bounce around.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, thanks for reading. You won&rsquo;t find a comment section here, but if you ever want to share your thoughts on a piece, just take a screenshot and shoot me a DM. I&rsquo;d feel super blessed to hear from you.</p>
